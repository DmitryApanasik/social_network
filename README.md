# Social Network “Wall”

This project is developed during the course "Technologies of Development and Testing Software"

# Analogs

This social network will have something in common with Twitter, where your thoughts can be reflected and shared through words and pictures. Also Pinterest could be mentioned, but unlike this website the main idea of “The Wall” would be not in collecting and posting inspirational photos, but creating inspirational posts by yourself.
